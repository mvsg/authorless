Web extension to hide authors of facebok posts

Authorless is a simple Google Chrome browser extension that hides meta data of the author of posts in your Facebook timeline. This way it makes the authors of posts disappear and leaves you only with the content of the message and the additional comments. It disconnects the message from the author and thereby changes the content significantly with just minimal effort.

Run extension:
To run simply download all files and move them to a folder called 'authorless'. Open 'Chrome' with activated developer mode. Navigate to 'Window > Extensions' and drag the folder 'authorless' in it.
