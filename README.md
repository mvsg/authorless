# authorless
Web extension to hide authors of facebok posts.

Authorless is a simple Google Chrome browser extension that hides meta data of the author of posts in your Facebook timeline. This way it makes the authors of posts disappear and leaves you only with the content of the message and the additional comments. It disconnects the message from the author and thereby changes the content significantly with just minimal effort.

Run extension:

1. To run this extension simply download all files. Do so by going to github.com/mvsg/authorless and selecting "Clone or Download" and the "Download ZIP".

2. Make sure they are all sitting in one folder. Open the browser 'Chrome' with activated developer mode.

3. Activate the developer mode by selecting Chrome > Window > Extensions. Make sure the "Developer Mode" checkbox is checked.

4. Navigate to Window > Extensions and drag the folder containing all files into it.
